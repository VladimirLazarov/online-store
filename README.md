# Online Store Project

## Description
This is an online store project built with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). It allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, and complete a purchase. The project demonstrates my skills in full-stack development, including front-end design, back-end API development, and database integration.
